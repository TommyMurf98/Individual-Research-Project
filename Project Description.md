# Individual-Research-Project
This project is a research study focused on exploring weapon balance and popularity in battle royale games, with a specific emphasis on *Call of Duty: Warzone 2*. The goal is to investigate patterns in the popularity of certain guns and how developers address imbalances through "balance patches." The research aims to understand why certain guns become more dominant and how game publishers attempt to create a more balanced variety of weapons in first-person shooter (FPS) games.

Here’s a breakdown of the files and their purposes:

1. **Ethical Approval Form**: This document outlines the ethical considerations of the project, stating that no significant ethical issues were identified, and the research primarily uses data from questionnaires and publicly available datasets on gun popularity in *Warzone 2*. The study does not involve vulnerable groups, sensitive data, or other high-risk ethical concerns【10†source】.

2. **Google Forms Questionnaire**: The questionnaire asks participants about their gaming habits and opinions on weapon variety and balance in *Warzone 2*. It collects data on how players perceive weapon popularity and the role of certain types of guns in achieving success in the game【13†source】.

3. **Jupyter Notebook**: The Python notebook, titled *Individual Research Project.ipynb*, contains the developed software for analyzing the data from the questionnaire. Once opened and executed in Jupyter, it loads the data from the associated Excel sheet and generates graphs based on the responses【11†source】.

4. **Excel Data Sheet (Demo Responses)**: This sheet contains the raw responses from participants of the questionnaire, which are processed and analyzed in the Jupyter notebook to generate insights about the patterns of weapon popularity【11†source】【12†source】.

5. **Graph Results**: These are visual representations of the data collected from the survey responses, illustrating trends and patterns related to weapon balance and player preferences【12†source】.

In summary, the project examines how weapon choices and balance in *Warzone 2* influence gameplay, using a combination of survey data and analysis tools developed in Python. The findings aim to shed light on how game publishers manage weapon variety and balance in battle royale games.
